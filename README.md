About this project

Beverage Sales Performance Dashboard â€“ Power BI
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze a simulated dataset of beverage industry sales. The dataset includes business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions and was designed to reflect realistic patterns in customer behavior, seasonal fluctuations, and regional preferences.

Objective
The primary objective was to transform raw sales data into a set of interactive dashboards that offer clear, actionable insights for business stakeholders. The dashboard allows users to monitor revenue trends, understand customer segmentation, evaluate product performance, and assess geographic sales distribution.

Key Features
-Sales Overview Page: Presents key performance indicators such as total revenue, quantity sold, number of orders, and distinct customers. Includes visual breakdowns by customer type and category.
-Regional Insights Page: Highlights revenue by region and customer type through bar charts and geographic maps, enabling identification of top-performing areas.
-Product and Category Analysis: Analyzes revenue by category and product, using visuals such as treemaps and scatter plots to highlight top-performing SKUs and category-level sales trends.
-Customer Segmentation and Behavior: Includes donut charts, funnel visuals, and detailed tables to compare B2B and B2C purchasing patterns. Measures customer count, revenue contribution, and quantity sold by customer type.
-Seasonality and Trends: Tracks monthly and quarterly revenue trends using line and combination charts. A decomposition tree is used to explore drivers behind revenue changes across time, region, category, and customer type.

Skills and Tools Used:
-Power BI for dashboard development and layout design
-DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for custom measures, including total revenue, total quantity, average order value, and customer-specific insights
-Data modeling and relationship management
-Visual analytics techniques to support user interaction and guided exploration


Outcome:
This project showcases a robust ability to design data-driven business dashboards that align with stakeholder goals and support strategic decision-making. The dashboard is structured to deliver both high-level summaries and detailed analytical views across customer, product, and time dimensions.
